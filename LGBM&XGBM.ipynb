        "This assignment demonstrated how machine learning algorithms like LightGBM and XGBoost can be effectively used to predict Titanic passenger survival. Through data exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, and model building, we identified key features such as Sex, Age, and Passenger Class that strongly influenced survival outcomes. After training and tuning both models, LightGBM slightly outperformed XGBoost in terms of recall and F1 score, making it the preferred model for this task. Overall, the project highlighted the importance of feature engineering, model evaluation, and algorithm comparison in building accurate predictive models."
